The Power Plant (PPData) dataset contains high-frequency operational time-series data from a grate-fired boiler power generation facility, sampled at 10-second intervals. The dataset monitors 42 operational parameters across critical subsystems including feedwater pumps, induced draft fans, grate combustion air system (center, low-side, and high-side), furnace pressure and temperature, flue gas cooling system, economizer with oxygen monitoring, air preheater, steam drum pressure and water level control, desuperheater valves, and feedwater flow rates. The target variable is generator active power output (OT), representing real-time electrical power generation in megawatts. This multivariate time series enables precise short-term and long-term forecasting of power output based on complex interactions among boiler operational parameters.
